# Project Title
Visiting card design - UI -HTML CSS

## 🚀 Features
  1. Necessary details like name , designation, contact email details.
1. Layout and hierarchy of elements can direct the user the capture details easily.
2. Using alignment , spacing , colour, padding to the  elements that makes which information to be standout.

UI point of view I focused on ,

1. Outline my idea as basic wireframe.
2. Designing logo using Adobe illustrator and learned how to export high resolution image.
3. Flex layout properties like “display: flex, flex-direction: column/row” helped to arrange the elements as column and row direction .
4. Using bootstrap classes like “col-sm-8” , “col-sm-4” helped to arrange elements inside container.
5. Baselined the source code in Github.
6. Code deployment using Netlify .
7. At last got a new thought when I had discussion with my friend, to have Whats app qrcode at the back of the card so that we can quickly access the contact details without typing manually or run out of card.Feature 1
